# NEST Client -- A client for the NEST Server

This repository contains a simple and generic Python-based client to
talk to talk to the [NEST Simulator](http://nest-simulator.org) via
its REST-based interface [NEST
Server](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/connect_nest/nest_server.html).

The directory `examples` holds some examples that demostrate the
usage of the client.
